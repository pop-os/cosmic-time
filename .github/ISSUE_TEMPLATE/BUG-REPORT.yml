        If your application is crashing during startup or you are observing graphical glitches, there is a chance it may be caused by incompatible hardware or outdated graphics drivers.

        Before filing an issue...

        - If you are using `wgpu`, you need an environment that supports Vulkan, Metal, or DirectX 12. Please, make sure you can run [the `wgpu` examples].
        - If you are using `glow`, you need support for OpenGL 2.1+. Please, make sure you can run [the `glow` examples].

        If you have any issues running any of the examples, make sure your graphics drivers are up-to-date. If the issues persist, please report them to the authors of the libraries directly!
